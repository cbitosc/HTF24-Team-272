      <p>
        The Sentiment Analysis Tool allows users to input text from social
        media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to analyze
        the emotional tone of their posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model, it classifies posts as
        positive, negative, or neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project aims to make sentiment analysis accessible to everyone,
        providing quick insights into the emotional impact of social media
        content.
